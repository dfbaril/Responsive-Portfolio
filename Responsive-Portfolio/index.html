<!-- So some of this code is a little janky and "hacked". Even so, I can't always get the 
    footer to stay on the bottom of the page, without being fixed (but then it's fixed...)
     But hey, it works on my 1440p display, so it must work on all devices.
     Also, there are a lot of CSS properties that are redundant, but I'll fix it later. -->

            <p>Dain Baril is an individual with a burgeoning interest in web-development. He created this site primarily to learn about HTML and CSS, and how they interact together. His main interests are in the history of antiquity, especially military history, and motorsports. Dain has wanted to be everything from a professional chess player to a racecar driver, but it seems he can't stay focused on anything for long. He appreciates rhetoric, strong leadership, efficient workplaces, and people who are just way too goofy. He has been told that he's a little too serious, but those people don't realize that his favorite jokes usually involve fart noises.</p>
